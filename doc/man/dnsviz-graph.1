.TH dnsviz-graph 1 "26 Aug 2015" "v0.4.0"
.SH NAME
dnsviz-graph \- graph the assessment of diagnostic DNS queries
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dnsviz graph [options]
.I [domain_name...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Process the results of diagnostic DNS queries previously performed, e.g., using
\fI"dnsviz probe"\fP, to assess the health of the associated DNS deployments
for one or more domain names specified.  The results of this processing are
presented in one of several graphical formats for user diagnostics.

The source of the diagnostic query input is either a file specified with
\fI-r\fP or standard input.

Domain names to be processed may be passed either as command-line arguments, in
a file (using the \fI-f\fP option), or simply implied using the diagnostic
query input.  The latter is the preferred methodology (and the simplest) and is
useful, except in cases where the input contains diagnostic queries for
multiple domain names, only a subset of which are to be processed.

If \fI-f\fP is not used and no domain names are supplied on the command line,
then the domain names to be processed are extracted from the diagnostic query
input.  If the \fI-f\fP option is used, then names may not be specified on the
command line.

The domain names passed as input are fully-qualified domain names, such as
example.com, www.example.com, _443._tcp.example.com, 1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa, or
8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.  Because it is implied that specified domain names
are fully qualified, no trailing dot is necessary.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-f <filename>"
Read names from a file (one name per line), instead of from command line.

If this option is used, then names may not be specified on the command line.
.IP "-r <filename>"
Read diagnostic query input from the specified file, instead of from standard
input.
.IP "-t <filename>"
Specify a file that contains trusted keys for processing diagnostic queries.

The format of this file is master zone file format and should contain DNSKEY
records that correspond to one more trusted keys for one or more DNS zones.
.IP "-R <type>[,<type>...]"
Process queries of only the specified type(s) (e.g., A, AAAA).  The default is
to process all types queried as part of the diagnostic input.
.IP -O
Save the output to a file, whose name is derived from the format (i.e.,
provided to \fI-T\fP) and the domain name.

If this option is used when the diagnostic queries of multiple domain name are
being processed, a file will be created for each domain name processed.
.IP "-o <filename>"
Write the output to the specified file instead of to standard output, which
is the default.

If this option is used when the diagnostic queries of multiple domain name are
being processed, a single file (the one specified) will be created, which will
contain the collective output for all domain names processed.
.IP "-T <format>"
Specify the format of the format from among the following: "txt", "dot", "png",
"jpg", "svg", and "html".  The default is "txt".

All output formats except "txt" are created using \fIdot(1)\fP, which outputs
the image of a directed graph.  The "html" format makes this image interactive
using javascript libraries that are distributed with this software.

The "txt" output is appropriate for terminal text file output, using colors
(where supported by the terminal) and symbols to designate status and errors in
a loosely-defined textual format.
.IP -h
Display the usage and exit.

.SH EXIT CODES
The exit codes are:
.IP 0
Program terminated normally.
.IP 1
Incorrect usage.
.IP 2
Required package dependencies were not found.
.IP 3
There was an error processing the input or saving the output.
.IP 4
Program execution was interrupted, or an unknown error ocurred.
